This is an (incomplete) guide with useful information that should be taken into account when making translations. The translation should reference terms from the official Yen Press translation of the anime where light novels/manga.

The text will likely go through several passes of proofreading to ensure it remains consistent, so please don’t worry about re-checking through your work/following the style precisely at this stage.

Terms are taken from the old translation work and by no means final. Do feel free to suggest changes to anything in the discord channel!

==Text Editing (from the readme)==
-Rename the *_output.txt files to *_input.txt (bin_output.txt to bin_input.txt, etc) and add translations for each line after the "=" sign.
-The text in wsb_input is automatically wordwrapped, but a "|" can be used to force a line break.
-New textboxes can be added by appending ">>" followed by the new text.
-Control codes are specified as <XX> or UNK(XXXX), they should usually be kept.
-To blank out a line, use a single "!". If just left empty, the line will be left untranslated.
-Comments can be added at the end of lines by using #

==Style==
-Text should be in English (US) spellings, e.g. “color” instead of “colour”
-Sound effects should be ‘westernized’, e.g. うーん > “Hmm/Well...”, ケッケッ > “Heh heh.” Any that can’t be effectively made into an onomatopoeia should be surrounded by *’s, e.g. はぁ > “*Sigh*”
-To represent Holo’s archaic-ish speech, don’t use any contractions e.g. “will not” instead of “won’t" and change “it is” to “’tis”. Her dialogue is usually wordy (think of a princess; each sentence is ‘proper’, and slang is avoided.) Props if you can use words that have fallen out of fashion.
-Choices should end with a full stop or appropriate punctuation if parts of dialogue.
-Replace double ellipses “……” with the standard “...” Ellipses that represent a pause within a word should be flush with the text on both sides. E.g. "W...What is that?" Ellipses that represent a pause between words are flush with the text on the left, and are followed by a space on the right. "That... can’t be..."
-Rather than following the original formatting exactly, ellipses can be used to represent slower text progression, whereas ‘--’ can be used to represent a fast pace, or interrupted dialogue.  
-Stutters should be capitalized e.g. “R-Right...”
-If a title is being used to replace a name, it should be capitalized e.g. “Good morning, Innkeeper.” If it’s proceeded by ‘the’ or a possessive pronoun e.g. ‘my’, it is not replacing a name and so does not need a capital letter e.g. “the innkeeper is busy”.
-The C in “the Church” (教会) should also be capitalized.
