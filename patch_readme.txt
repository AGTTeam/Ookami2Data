If this is your first time patching a game, we recommend taking a quick look at our beginner’s guide before continuing. https://agtteam.tumblr.com/beginnersguide

Before you can play the translation, you'll need to patch the game on your computer using a legal copy of the ROM. There are two methods by which this can be done, online, via the ROMhacking.net downloads page, or locally by downloading an additional piece of software.

                         ============================
                                ONLINE METHOD        
                         ============================

-On the ROMhacking.net download page, navigate to “Patch Online NOW!” under the ‘Links’ header.
-Upload your ROM using the “Choose File” button where prompted.
-Click “Apply Patch”, and wait for the download to complete. You should now have a patched copy of the ROM, labelled ‘-input source- (patched)’.

                         ===========================
                               SOFTWARE METHOD      
                         ===========================

-Download DeltaPatcher from https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/
-Extract the file, and run either DeltaPatcher or DeltaPatcherLite
-'Original file' should be your copy of the ROM, as an '.nds' filetype.
-For 'XDelta patch', choose the 'UmioWataruPatch.xdelta' file.
-Hit apply patch, and you're good to go!
*Note that this will overwrite your original file. If you’d like to keep a copy of it instead, change the settings by clicking the cog icon, and tick “Backup original file”. This will create a new ‘--PATCHED.nds’ file instead.

***NOTE: ROM DUMP COMPATIBILITY***
This patch is designed to work with a 100% correctly dumped ROM (CRC: B2EA6D73).

If your ROM is a bad dump (CRC: CC9640AB), you can apply the "bad_to_good.xdelta" patch BEFORE applying the translation patch by following the guide above.

To check which ROM you have, use https://www.romhacking.net/hash/ to compare the values.

=Troubleshooting=

An “xdelta3: target window checksum mismatch: XD3_INVALID_INPUT” error may occur when trying to patch the incorrect ROM. Make sure that your ROM isn’t already patched, else apply the "bad_to_good_dump.xdelta" patch to the bad dump BEFORE applying the translation patch.

Alternatively, using DeltaPatcherLite, change the settings (the cog symbol next to the ‘Apply patch’ button) and untick “Checksum Validation”.

                   *****************************************

CHEATS
The patch comes with a translated cheats file ready to be used with the emulator DeSmuME if so desired (UmioWataruCheats.dct). These can also be used with other emulators/flashcarts, however may require you to do some additional setup first. Please consult a guide for your specific software for instructions on what to do.

FLASHCART COMPATIBILTY
Some flashcarts have been found to randomly crash when playing the opening movie in both the patched, and unpatched game. We recommend that anyone experiencing crashing simply skips the movie by tapping the touch screen or pressing any button. The rest of the game should be playable as normal.

SUBTITLES
You may notice a full or partial black line flash up for a second when subtitles begin playing. Subtitles are used for the opening movie, end credits and special messages. This is merely a visual error and should not cause any playback issues.

BUG FIX
The patch contains a fix for a rare bug present in the original game which prevented the contract to deliver 1 Milk, 1 Egg and 2 Mussels to Dielmon from being completed.

RUMOR EXTENSION
The line spacing of the large white speech bubbles (rumors, hints, etc.), was adjusted to allow for six lines to be used instead of five. This is consistent with what was done for the first game, My Year with Holo.

BG CHANGE
The background images used in Norah’s “Shoulder Massage” event have been changed from a day street scene to an inn at night to better fit the mood.
