If this is your first time patching a game, we recommend taking a quick look at our beginner’s guide before continuing. https://agtteam.tumblr.com/beginnersguide

Before you can play the translation, you'll need to patch the game on your computer using a legal copy of the ROM. There are two methods by which this can be done, online, via the ROMhacking.net downloads page, or locally by downloading an additional piece of software.

                         ============================
                                ONLINE METHOD        
                         ============================

-On the ROMhacking.net download page, navigate to “Patch Online NOW!” under the ‘Links’ header.
-Upload your ROM using the “Choose File” button where prompted.
-Click “Apply Patch”, and wait for the download to complete. You should now have a patched copy of the ROM, labelled ‘-input source- (patched)’.

                         ===========================
                               SOFTWARE METHOD      
                         ===========================

-Download DeltaPatcher from https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/
-Extract the file, and run either DeltaPatcher or DeltaPatcherLite
-'Original file' should be your copy of the ROM, as an '.nds' filetype.
-For 'XDelta patch', choose the 'UmioWataruPatch.xdelta' file.
-Hit apply patch, and you're good to go!
*Note that this will overwrite your original file. If you’d like to keep a copy of it instead, change the settings by clicking the cog icon, and tick “Backup original file”. This will create a new ‘--PATCHED.nds’ file instead.

CHEATS
The patch comes with a translated cheats file ready to be used with the emulator DeSmuME if so desired (UmioWataruCheats.dct). These can also be used with other emulators/flashcarts, however may require you to take extra steps first. Please consult a guide for your specific software for instructions on what to do.

SUBTITLES
You may notice a full or partial black line flash up for a second when subtitles begin playing. Subtitles are used for the opening movie, end credits and special messages. This is merely a visual error and should not cause any playback issues.

BUG FIX
The patch contains a fix for a rare bug present in the original game which prevented the completion of the contract to deliver 1 Milk, 1 Egg and 2 Mussels to Dielmon.

RUMOR EXTENSION
The line spacing of the large white speech bubbles (rumors, hints, etc.), was adjusted to allow for six lines to be used instead of five. This is consistent with what was done for the first game, My Year with Holo.

BG CHANGE
The background images used in Norah’s “Shoulder Massage” event have been changed from a day street scene to an inn at night to better fit the mood.
